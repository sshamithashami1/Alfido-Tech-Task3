🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview:

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and family size.
Using Machine Learning, the model identifies patterns in the historical dataset to classify survival outcomes.

🚀 Features:
Data Loading & Cleaning
Handling Missing Values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Feature Engineering
Model Training using:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (optional)
Model Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision & recall
Prediction on new passenger data
Fully implemented in Jupyter Notebook

🧠 Technologies Used:
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Scikit-Learn
Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset:
The database includes passenger features like:
Pclass – Ticket class
Sex – Gender
Age – Passenger age
SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch – Number of parents/children aboard
Fare – Ticket price
Embarked – Port of embarkation
Survived – Target label (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
